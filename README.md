# Uniqueness of Graphical Methods for Optimal Control of Energy Storage

## Overview

This repository contains the relevant code and resources related to the proof that the optimal control is unique and independent of the convex cost function. The proof is structured using a set of lemmas that establish key properties of the optimal generated energy function ùëä(ùë°). 

The project focuses on proving the uniqueness of the "shortest-path" optimal solution for power management in energy storage dynamic models, which builds upon a previously introduced graphical design procedure. The core of this project involves a rigorous proof established through five consequential lemmas, each defining a distinct characteristic of the optimal solution. These lemmas are synthesized to demonstrate that the optimal solution corresponds to the shortest path of generated energy within defined boundaries.

The efficacy of this unique solution is validated through two comparative tests: one using synthetic data to benchmark the solution against reinforcement learning algorithms, and another using real-world data from an electrical vehicle storage device to compare against numerical methods. The analytical proof aims to enhance understanding of low-complexity methods and enable better benchmarking of high-complexity solution methods like those based on reinforcement learning. The project also includes comparative analysis of the proposed method with other algorithms in energy balancing scenarios and electrical vehicle simulations.

* Proof Diagram: The proof_diagram.pdf file provides a visual representation of the proof structure.
* Code Implementation: Relevant scripts to illustrate the theoretical results numerically.
* Mathematical Lemmas:
  * Lemma 1 (Straight Flow): The optimal generated power remains constant unless constrained by the energy requirement.
  * Lemma 2 (Tangent & Continuous): The curve of optimal generated energy must be tangent to its bounding constraints.
  * Lemma 3 (Up-Increasing, Down-Decreasing): The optimal energy cannot remain at the upper bound when the power is decreasing, nor at the lower bound when the power is increasing.
  * Lemma 4 (Uniqueness Between Monotones): If the optimal energy moves in a straight line between two constrained intervals, this segment is unique.
  * Lemma 5 (Most Distant Reachable Interval): The optimal energy must move in a straight line to the most distant monotone interval possible.
  * Final Proof Statement: Establishes that the optimal generated energy function is unique due to its behavior in constrained and unconstrained intervals.
